## What does this Python Project do? 

By using this Python Project, you should be able to:

1. **Identify** new proposed generating projects across the U.S.
2. **Explain** various elements regarding these proposed generating projects, including:
    - *Where* are these projects located?
    - *What* technology is most prominent?
    - *How* many projects are there?
    
    
3. **Calculate** the average size of these projects, by technology, including state totals


## How to use this Python Project:

1. Read this *README.md* file
2. Open the **Final Project** *JupyterLab NoteBook* referenced below
3. Run All cells in the *NoteBook*, or Run them one-by-one, per your preference

## Areas for Improvement / Limitations:
- Add scraping code;
- Add more analytics;
- Add more datasets;
- Improve user interface (i.e. sharing), and
- Expand to other EIA datasets.
