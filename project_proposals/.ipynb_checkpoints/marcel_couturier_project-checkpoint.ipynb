    "# **Problem Statement**\n",
    "    \n",
    "Tracking proposed generating projects in the energy sector in the United States is a constant challenge, as it's constantly evolving and difficult to track down a reliable source.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The Energy Information Administration (or \"EIA\") publishes, through its annual survey Form EIA-860, data  about existing and planned generators. The planned generators dataset in this survey could be used to identify and track the evolution of proposed generating projecs. This information is publicly available on the EIA's website: [Form-860](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia860\n",
    "\"EIA Form-860\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Isolating this information on a regular basis can be tedious, time consuming, and if done manually, can result in datasets that contain errors (i.e. typos, etc.).\n",
    "    \n",
    "This <span style=\"color:blue\"> Python project </span> will look to address this manual process with code that replaces as many manual steps (or processes) as possible to ensure, timely and accurate results. In addition, data quality permitting, of course, a series of analytics might be explored and/or derived using Pandas seen in class.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Success Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, if successful, this python project and its supporting analytics should expedite the process of getting the appropriate datasets from the EIA and shed some light on the evolution (and composition) of planned generation projects in the energy sector in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Significant Risks\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several significant risks to this project, including but not limited to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dealing with missing or incomplete datasets could affect results (*i.e. dealing with \"NaN\", etc.*);\n",
    "* Overwriting or deleting the source datasets without knowing;\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some limitations to this project, including but not limited to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dataset(s) chosen might be scaled back to allow for easier analytics (*i.e. will only use 2018 and 2017 data, for comparison purposes)*;\n",
    "* Dataset(s) chosen might be adapted to fit data formats seen in Class;\n",
    "* Results derived from the dataset(s) can only be as good as dataset(s) themselves (*i.e. \"garbage in, garbage out\"*);\n",
    "\n",
    "*Mitigation Measures*\n",
    "\n",
    "* In order to mitigate some of the limitations outlined above, continuous inspection of data samples for quality and completness should be performed as steps are performed.\n",
